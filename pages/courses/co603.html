description: "Networking technology overview. Protocol design and validation using the finite state 
              automata in conjunction with time-lines. Overview of the IEEE802 network data link protocol 
              standards. Addressing at the data link and network layers. Network layer services. Introduction 
              to routing algorithms such as Distance Vector and Link State. Congestion control mechanisms. 
              Internetworking issues in connecting networks. The Internet Protocol Suite overview. 
              The Internet protocols IPv4 and IPv6. Address resolution using ARP and RARP. 
              Transport layer: issues, transport protocols TCP and UDP. 
              Application level protocols such as: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), 
              Domain Name System (DNS) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). 
              There is a substantial network programming component in the assessable material."
